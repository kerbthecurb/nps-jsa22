            The Majestic Citadel of Thang Long (or Hanoi Citadel) is a complex of notable royal buildings found within
            the center of Hanoi, Vietnam. It was first built amid the Ly dynasty when they moved to Hanoi in 1010.
            Having existed for over a thousand years, numerous structures inside were torn down and vanished, but within
            the early 2000s, the Hanoi Citadel was efficiently unearthed. Now it has become a favorite destination for
            both local people and guests, and many important ceremonies and celebrations were held here, including the
            Mid – Autumn festival.
