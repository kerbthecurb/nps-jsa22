        <p class="text1">
            Before you taste these delicious Vietnamese mooncakes, you may well be inquisitive how they
            made it to our mid-autumn treats. The word 'mooncake' to begin with, showed up during the rule of
            the Ming. Since then mooncakes became the staple of the Mid Autumn Festival. In spite of the fact that no
            one knows precisely when mooncakes came
            to Vietnam, but over hundreds of years the Vietnamese nourishment has frequently been changed by Chinese
            involvement.

            In Vietnam, Tết Trung Thu is seen as a extraordinary time for families and friends. Once a year,
            after a productive harvest, families and relatives would join in to unwind, sing songs and drink tea
            beneath the light of the total moon. Children would stay up late, carrying star lights
            running around villages and tuning in for the drums of lion artists. Square mooncakes is said to communicate
            with the soil and
            circular mooncakes speak to the sky and bring luck to the humans.

        <p class="text2">
            Long ago there were only two types of mooncakes in Vietnam. The exquisite savoury mooncakes were
            made of up to 10 fillings, lime leafs, smoked sausages, lotus seeds and so many more. These mooncakes would
            be made in square molds and cooked in the oven. These cakes
            would be put on family sacrificial tables and shared between family members. Another special type of
            mooncake
            were made with sticky rice flour to be eaten without baking. They are usually used in Buddhist pagodas or
            eaten at
            home.

            Nowadays, you'll have numerous mooncake flavors to select from. Cooks now
            regularly utilize fixings such as lotus seed, coconut meat, dark sesame, nuts and rice to create
            large quantities mooncakes for everybody to share. More gutsy pastry specialists would offer pistachio,
            coffee, chocolate,
            jam, strawberry and even durian in mooncakes to further innovate this traditional treat.

        <p class="text3">
            Some of you might ask: "Why bother making a mooncake when you can just buy a pre-made mooncake?". In my
            opinion, there are very good pre-made mooncake shops in Vietnam, but you can't always be in Vietnam to buy
            these specialites; while pre-made mooncakes in the supermarket tend to be either bland or too sweet, and
            most
            smells stale. It is totally worth it to try and make these mooncakes at home, and rather it's quite easy.
            Down here are the simple steps to make one yourself...

            For the dough, you will need: Golden syrup (sugar, lemon juice, water); egg yolk; oil; flour and baking
            soda. For the filling you will need: Seeds (pumpkin seed, cashews (not salted); white sesame); salted duck
            egg; candied winter melon and ginger; orange peel and lime leaf; and lastly, either flossed roasted-chicken
            or lap cheong. You can totally skip the meat if you want the cake to be vegetarian. Make sure to chop up the
            leaves, candied fruits and meats.

        <br>
        <br>

        <p class="text5">
            1. Poach orange peel in boiling water for 10-15 seconds. Also poach lap cheong for 1-2 minutes.
            Julienne then mince orange peel and kaffir lime leaves finely. Cut candied winter melon and ginger into thin
            strips then dice into small pieces.
            <br>

            2. Cut lap cheong into thin strips then dice into small cubes. Cut pork floss into short pieces and shred
            roasted chicken into thin strips, if using.
            Add cashew to a food processor and pulse a couple of times. Then add all remaining nuts and pulse a few more
            times.
            <br>
            3. Add a bit of oil to a pan over medium heat. Then add roasted chicken and lap cheong, stir and cook
            briefly
            until fragrant. Add all other ingredients: pork floss, mixed nuts, candied fruits, orange peel and kaffir
            lime leaves to the
            pan. Stir to distribute all ingredients evenly in the mixture.
            <br>
            4. Add 2 tablespoons of water to the pan, stir to combine. Then add 1 tablespoon of Mei Kuei Lu wine, 1
            tablespoon of soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil to the mixture. Stir to combine
            thoroughly. You can taste and adjust the flavorings to taste.
            <br>
            5. Add 2 tablespoons of glutinous rice flour to the pan. Stir to combine thoroughly. The filling should
            stick
            to itself (not tightly, but not too loosely) when you press it together. If it does not stick, you can add a
            bit more oil and glutinous rice flour. Transfer to a plate to cool.
            <br>
            6. Place salted duck egg yolks in a heat-proof plate and mix gently with 2 teaspoons of Mei Kuei Lu wine and
            1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil. Cover and steam for 7 minutes, then set aside to cool.
            <br>
            7. Prepare a scale with a piece of plastic wrap on top. Place about 20-25 grams (0.7-0.9 oz) of filling on
            top
            of the plastic wrap, then place a salted egg yolk, and top with enough filling so that the total weight is
            60 grams (2.1 oz).
            <br>
            8. Wrap the plastic wrap around the filling, twist, turn and apply pressure to form the
            filling into a small ball. Continue with the remaining filling. We
            will need 8 small balls of filling.

            Add flour either to a blending bowl or on a clean working surface. Sprinkle baking soda over flour and then

            Make a small well within the center of the flour, then add an egg yolk and 30 grams (1 oz) of oil. Utilize
            your hand to break the egg and blend it with the oil. Then add the brilliant syrup. Fold and work the blend
            into a smooth mixture. Shape it into a ball, cover, and rest for 40-45 minutes.
            After resting the batter, work it briefly, just for a few seconds. Then separate the mixture into 8 pieces,

            Take a batter ball and flatten it out together with your fingers or with a rolling pin. Put the filling ball
            in the center. Wrap the dough around the filling to seal the filling completely. You can see how to do this
            in the video. Proceed to wrap all the filling balls with the dough balls.
            Cover your hands with flour, this will help unstuck the dough. Roll the mooncake in your hands to gently
            dust it with flour. Too much flour will make the mooncake dry and some dough may come apart
            Place the mooncake into the form, at that point put the mold on a flat surface and slowly press the handle.
            You will have to discharge the handle, press once more and repeat a couple of times. The first press can be
            tender, then increase the weight with subsequent presses. Tidy the bottom with extra flour as required.
            Check the bottom of the shape. In the event that all corners are evenly filled with mixture, you'll release
            the cake from the mold.

        <p class="text5">
            Preheat your oven to 365°F or 185°C. Arrange mooncakes on a heating sheet lined with parchment paper.
            Utilize a small and sharp needle to poke a few little gaps on the top and on the sides of the cakes. Try to
            make the gaps not too obvious. Prepare for 10 minutes.
            While heating the cakes, plan the egg wash by blending all the fixings for the egg wash together.
            Take the cakes out of the stove and lower the stove temperature to 330°F or 165°C. Carefully brush all sides
            and the best of the cakes with egg wash. Do not let an excess egg wash fill the holes on the top of the
            cakes or the designs will not turn out beautiful. Bake the cakes for another 7 minutes.
            Take the cakes out of the oven and brush all sides and the top one more time. At that point bake for another
            7-8 minutes or until the cakes are brilliant.
            Let the mooncakes cool completely on the heating sheet. At that point store them in a cool, dry place and
            cover. They taste best after around 2-3 days. After 3 days, you'll be able store them in the fridge for 1-2
            weeks.
